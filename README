This sample flask project uses Flask, Angular.js and Python together for a small
MVC type application.

How to Run:

    python pythonapp/server/app/run.py

Notes about static folder:
    1: This demo has a SPA (Single Page Architecture), so main contents are inside 'index.html'.
    2: All the partials are inside static/app/partials folder.
    3: All the controllers for angular are inside static/app/js/controllers folder.

Notes about server folder:
    1: The app is run from server/run.py, and the port configurations are done here.
    2: The requirements.txt contains the bare minimum modules which needs to be installed.
    3: The server configurations like template/static folders are done inside server.py file.
